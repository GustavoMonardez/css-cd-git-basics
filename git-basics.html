                <h2>What is Git?</h2>
                <p>Git is a version control sytem; you can think of it as a series of snapshots (commits) of your code base.
                    With the creation of each snapshopt you build out a whole application, seeing the growth of a full app.
                    During this time you can make branches to experiment and come back to a previous snapshot you took or
                    merge those experiments into your app.</p>
                <h2>What is Github?</h2>
                <p>Githut is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together
                    on projects from anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during development.</p>

                            <a href="#">Git init</a> is the act of registering this current code base.</p>

                        <h3>Git add</h3>
                        <p>
                            <a href="#">Git add</a> is how we stage the integration of our current code base into our current list of
                            snapshots.
                        </p>

                            <a href="#">Git status</a> allows us to see the changes we are going to make.</p>

                        <p>
                            <a href="#">Git commit</a>; finally we can commit hose changes we added to our last snapshot giving us a
                            new snapshot of our code with whatever new changes were made.</p>

                            <a href="#">Git remote add</a> is used to set up an online repository where we can place all of our current
                            code. This is where the outside world can see our codebase.</p>

                            <a href="#">Git push</a> is how we get our code to Github, an excellent place to store all of our repositories.
                            Other developers might look at our existing projects to see how we approached problems, pull down
                            our code and add new features or even update our code base with features they wanted to add.</p>
